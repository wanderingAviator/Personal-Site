                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> I am a James Madison University Computer Science Alumni with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Robotics. I have been 
                    around computers for as long as I can remember, and my Dad, a huge inspiration for me, has worked for the Federal Reserve in their
                    Systems Analyst department since I was a kid, so I always knew I wanted to work with computers when I grew up. Seeing how far I've 
                    come from taking beginner programming classes in high school, to completing the rigorous Computer Science curriculum at JMU, to the 
                    various Cloud courses offered by the companies that have taken me on as a fresh college graduate, I'm proud and happy to be able to 
                    offer my skills to projects that impact the lives of millions of people all around the world, just like my dad does!

                    The Computer Science curriculum at JMU was one of the most broadly well-rounded Computer Science experiences I've particiapted in. From algorithms, 
                    to fundamentals of programming languages, to Operating Systems, to distributed systems and threading; The rigor of the program, sheer quantity 
                    of content, and most importantly, support from the fantastic team of Professors made the Computer Science program the best first-time experience 
                    with the industry I could have asked for. I even felt encouraged to further take on and complete their Robotics Minor program, which laid down the 
                    fundamentals for my Python experience, as well as a deeper dive into machine learning and other AI algorithms, like path finding.

                        My most recent work experience is with Cognixiaâ€™s JUMP program, a hyper-intense technical training program that 
                        gives top STEM talent from across the U.S. the equivalent of 12-18 months of industry experience. 
                        In the program, not only do you up-skill your technical abilities, but you also evolve your digital mindset to successfully 
                        adapt and utilize technology in an efficient manner in preparation for deployment with Collabera clients.

                        My most valued experience from my time working for Capgemini had to have been the Cloud experience and training I received. Starting with my
                        Microsoft Azure certification in late 2021, to my training in Hashicorp Terraform, the training I received was fundamental to my success in other
                        Cloud provider certification exams, like Amazon AWS. I owe much of my cloud experience to the training I received at Capgemini.

                        A maze generator and solver, written in Java. This project focused on the application of Graph theory, Kruskall's Algorithm, 
                        and provided an interesting crash course in all that can go right and wrong with maze solving! Front end provided by
                        the CS Professors of James Madison University.
